- Hola! I’m Ernesto, a 3D artist and creative.
- I'm a Technical character Animation Intern at EPIC Games. Previously, I was a character rigging intern at SONY Pictures Imageworks.
- I'm expanding my knowledge in tool development for film and games to make creating art more accessible and intutive.
